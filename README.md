# Code for 20.C51 Final Project

For this project I use ESM2 protein embeddings to predict the function of variants of unknown significance. Specifically, I train a classifier on a deep mutational scan of the tumor suppressor p53 published by [Giacomelli et al.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-018-0204-y#data-availability).
